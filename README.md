# Todo Decentralised App

The smart contracts are kept in contracts directory.

Compile Smart Contracts `truffle compile`

Migrate Smart Contracts `truffle migrate --reset`

Now, your contracts are deployed in the blockchain.

This project has been created with [truffle-box-react][1] which is a marriage of [Truffle][2] and a React setup created with [create-react-app][3]. Either one would be a great place to start! [ethereum-todolist][4] Ethereum Todolist is where this project is taken from as the starting point.
